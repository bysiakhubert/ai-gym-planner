## TESTING

### Guidelines for E2E

#### PLAYWRIGHT

- Initialize configuration only with Chromium/Desktop Chrome browser
- Use browser contexts for isolating test environments
- Implement the Page Object Model for maintainable tests
- Use locators for resilient element selection
- Leverage API testing for backend validation
- Implement visual comparison with expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()
- Use the codegen tool for test recording
- Leverage trace viewer for debugging test failures
- Implement test hooks for setup and teardown
- Use expect assertions with specific matchers
- Leverage parallel execution for faster test runs

#### Configuration Location

- Playwright config: `playwright.config.ts`
- Custom fixtures: `e2e/fixtures/base.ts`
- Page Objects: `e2e/page-objects/`

#### Test File Structure

- Place tests in `e2e/` directory
- Use naming convention: `*.spec.ts`
- Create Page Objects for each major page in `e2e/page-objects/`
- Extend BasePage class for common functionality

#### Best Practices

- Use user-facing selectors: `getByRole()`, `getByLabel()`, `getByText()`
- Avoid hard-coded waits, use `waitForSelector()` or `waitForLoadState()`
- Isolate tests - each should be independent
- Use fixtures for common setup/teardown
- Leverage parallel execution for speed
- Use trace viewer for debugging: `npx playwright show-trace trace.zip`
